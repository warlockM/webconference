                                      The first thing that strikes you about Jagannath Temple is its resemblance to the temple in Puri. Located about 10 km from the main city, this 17th-century shrine is one of the most popular places in the city and is thus visited by innumerable tourists. The best time to visit the temple is undoubtedly during the Ratha Yatra which is held every year in the months of June-July. As the temple is built on a hill, you will have to climb several stairs to reach there. After seeking blessings, don’t forget to spend a few minutes enjoying the splendid views of the city from the top.

                                     There are some places which become a symbol for the city they are in; Jonha falls is one of those places. Breathtakingly beautiful, the first glimpse of these hanging valley falls is unforgettable and will stay with you long after you have left. The Gunga and Raru rivers merge and fall from a height of 141 ft. to add to the most amazing surroundings to watch. Even though it is visited by a number of tourists every day, it is far from over-crowded and you can easily find a quiet spot to enjoy your time.

                                      If long winding roads overlooking a breathtaking valley is what makes your holiday perfect, then you do not want to miss the Patratu Valley! Perhaps the best stretch you can find in the state of Jharkhand, the drive from Ranchi to the valley is every bike lover’s delight. The S-turns, hairpins and swooping corners, and the stunning vistas make the drive all the more exciting. You must stop at the Patratu Dam which is just as breathtaking and makes a great spot for picnicking.
